   # About Me
 ## My Interests
   In my free time I like to play video games with my friends. I am kicker for my high school football team and plan to play in college if possible. My faviorate subject in school is math and a close second is history. I plan to attened NC State University to get a bachelor  Computer Engineering.
## Websites I Recommend
[ESPN](https://www.espn.com/)  I recommend this website because it has all the sports news from around the world, so you can stay caught up.

[wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) I recommend this website because every day it posts a new word that you have to find within 6 guesses.It is super fun to try and guess these words.
